# AigcRoyaltiesFHE

**AigcRoyaltiesFHE** is a privacy-preserving platform designed to enable anonymous royalties for contributors to generative AI (AIGC) art models. Using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, the system calculates royalties based on encrypted contributions and model usage without exposing contributor identities or raw data.

---

## Project Background

Generative AI art platforms often face challenges in fairly distributing royalties:

- **Contributor anonymity:** Artists contributing data or style inputs may wish to remain anonymous.  
- **Data sensitivity:** Raw contribution data may be proprietary or sensitive.  
- **Fair computation:** Royalty calculation must accurately reflect contribution usage while protecting privacy.  
- **Trust and transparency:** Contributors need assurance that their royalties are computed fairly.  

**AigcRoyaltiesFHE solves these challenges** by performing royalty calculations on encrypted data, ensuring both fairness and confidentiality.

## Core Concepts

- **Encrypted Contributions:** Artists’ data and style inputs are encrypted at submission.  
- **FHE-Based Royalty Computation:** Compute usage-based royalties directly on encrypted data.  
- **Anonymous Payouts:** Contributors receive their share without revealing identity.  
- **Secure Model Usage Tracking:** Track AI model usage securely to determine proportional royalty distribution.

## Features

### Royalty Management

- **Encrypted Contribution Submission:** Artists submit inputs securely with client-side encryption.  
- **Fair Royalty Calculation:** Determine contributions’ impact on model usage without decryption.  
- **Anonymous Payment Processing:** Ensure payouts are delivered without linking to individual identities.  
- **Usage Analytics:** Aggregate encrypted statistics for insight into model consumption patterns.

### Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Encryption:** All contributions are encrypted before leaving the artist's device.  
- **FHE Computation:** Royalty calculations are performed on encrypted inputs without revealing sensitive data.  
- **Immutable Records:** Contribution logs and payout calculations are tamper-proof.  
- **No Identity Exposure:** Even platform administrators cannot access personal identities.

### Platform Governance

- **Transparent Auditing:** Encrypted computation allows verification without revealing raw contributions.  
- **Contributor Empowerment:** Artists maintain control over their data while receiving fair rewards.  
- **Secure Collaboration:** Multiple contributors can participate without exposing private datasets.  
- **Automated Distribution:** Royalty allocations can be computed and distributed automatically.
